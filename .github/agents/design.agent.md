> Usage: `accessibility <Figma URL, URL, or description>`

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Audit a design or page for WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance. See the **accessibility-review** skill for WCAG criteria reference and common issues checklist.

## Usage

```
accessibility $ARGUMENTS
```

Audit for accessibility: @$1

## Output

```markdown
## Accessibility Audit: [Design/Page Name]
**Standard:** WCAG 2.1 AA | **Date:** [Date]

| 1 | [Issue] | [3.3.2 Labels] | 🟢 Minor | [Fix] |

#### Robust
| # | Issue | WCAG Criterion | Severity | Recommendation |
|---|-------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | [Issue] | [4.1.2 Name, Role, Value] | 🟡 Major | [Fix] |

### Color Contrast Check
| Element | Foreground | Background | Ratio | Required | Pass? |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------|----------|-------|
| [Body text] | [color] | [color] | [X]:1 | 4.5:1 | ✅/❌ |

### Keyboard Navigation
| Element | Tab Order | Enter/Space | Escape | Arrow Keys |
|---------|-----------|-------------|--------|------------|
| [Element] | [Order] | [Behavior] | [Behavior] | [Behavior] |

| [Element] | [What SR says] | [Problem if any] |

### Priority Fixes
1. **[Critical fix]** — Affects [who] and blocks [what]
2. **[Major fix]** — Improves [what] for [who]
3. **[Minor fix]** — Nice to have
```

## If Connectors Available

If **~~design tool** is connected:
- Inspect color values, font sizes, and touch targets directly from Figma
- Check component ARIA roles and keyboard behavior in the design spec

If **~~project tracker** is connected:
- Create tickets for each accessibility finding with severity and WCAG criterion
- Link findings to existing accessibility remediation epics

## Tips

1. **Start with contrast and keyboard** — These catch the most common and impactful issues.
2. **Test with real assistive technology** — My audit is a great start, but manual testing with VoiceOver/NVDA catches things I can't.
3. **Prioritize by impact** — Fix issues that block users first, polish later.

---

## 📋 critique

> **Get structured design feedback on usability, hierarchy, and consistency**
>
> Usage: `critique <Figma URL, screenshot, or description>`

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Get structured design feedback across multiple dimensions. See the **design-critique** skill for the evaluation framework and feedback principles.

## Usage

```
critique $ARGUMENTS
```

Review the design: @$1

If a Figma URL is provided, pull the design from Figma. If a file is referenced, read it. Otherwise, ask the user to describe or share their design.

## What I Need From You

- **The design**: Figma URL, screenshot, or detailed description
- **Context**: What is this? Who is it for? What stage (exploration, refinement, final)?
- **Focus** (optional): "Focus on mobile" or "Focus on the onboarding flow"

## Output

```markdown
## Design Critique: [Design Name]

### Overall Impression
[1-2 sentence first reaction — what works, what's the biggest opportunity]

### Usability
| Finding | Severity | Recommendation |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| [Issue] | 🔴 Critical / 🟡 Moderate / 🟢 Minor | [Fix] |

### Visual Hierarchy
- **What draws the eye first**: [Element] — [Is this correct?]
- **Reading flow**: [How does the eye move through the layout?]
- **Emphasis**: [Are the right things emphasized?]

### Consistency
| Element | Issue | Recommendation |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| [Typography/spacing/color] | [Inconsistency] | [Fix] |

### Accessibility
- **Color contrast**: [Pass/fail for key text]
- **Touch targets**: [Adequate size?]
- **Text readability**: [Font size, line height]

### What Works Well
- [Positive observation 1]
- [Positive observation 2]

### Priority Recommendations
1. **[Most impactful change]** — [Why and how]
2. **[Second priority]** — [Why and how]
3. **[Third priority]** — [Why and how]
```

## If Connectors Available

If **~~design tool** is connected:
- Pull the design directly from Figma and inspect components, tokens, and layers
- Compare against the existing design system for consistency

If **~~user feedback** is connected:
- Cross-reference design decisions with recent user feedback and support tickets

## Tips

1. **Share the context** — "This is a checkout flow for a B2B SaaS" helps me give relevant feedback.
2. **Specify your stage** — Early exploration gets different feedback than final polish.
3. **Ask me to focus** — "Just look at the navigation" gives you more depth on one area.

## 📋 design-system

> **Audit, document, or extend your design system**
>
> Usage: `design-system [audit | document | extend] <component or system>`

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Manage your design system — audit for consistency, document components, or design new patterns.

## Usage

```
/design-system audit                    # Full system audit
/design-system document [component]     # Document a component
/design-system extend [pattern]         # Design a new component or pattern

See the **design-system-management** skill for guidance on token naming, component structure, and design system principles.

## If Connectors Available

If **~~design tool** is connected:
- Audit components directly in Figma — check naming, variants, and token usage
- Pull component properties and layer structure for documentation

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Search for existing component documentation and usage guidelines
- Publish updated documentation to your wiki

## Tips

1. **Start with an audit** — Know where you are before deciding where to go.
2. **Document as you build** — It's easier to document a component while designing it.
3. **Prioritize coverage over perfection** — 80% of components documented beats 100% of 10 components.

## 📋 handoff

> **Generate developer handoff specs from a design**
>
> Usage: `handoff <Figma URL or design description>`

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Generate comprehensive developer handoff documentation from a design. See the **design-handoff** skill for guidance on what to include and handoff principles.

## Usage

```
handoff $ARGUMENTS
```

Generate handoff specs for: @$1

If a Figma URL is provided, pull the design from Figma. Otherwise, work from the provided description or screenshot.

## Output

```markdown
## Handoff Spec: [Feature/Screen Name]

### Overview
[What this screen/feature does, user context]

### Layout
[Grid system, breakpoints, responsive behavior]

### Design Tokens Used
| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|

- **Long text**: [Truncation rules]
- **Loading**: [Skeleton or spinner]
- **Error**: [Error state appearance]

### Animation / Motion
| Element | Trigger | Animation | Duration | Easing |
|---------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| [Element] | [Trigger] | [Description] | [ms] | [easing] |

### Accessibility Notes
- [Focus order]
- [ARIA labels needed]
- [Keyboard interactions]
```

## If Connectors Available

If **~~design tool** is connected:
- Pull exact measurements, tokens, and component specs from Figma
- Export assets and generate a complete spec sheet

If **~~project tracker** is connected:
- Link the handoff to the implementation ticket
- Create sub-tasks for each section of the spec

## Tips

1. **Share the Figma link** — I can pull exact measurements, tokens, and component info.
2. **Mention edge cases** — "What happens with 100 items?" helps me spec boundary conditions.
3. **Specify the tech stack** — "We use React + Tailwind" helps me give relevant implementation notes.

## 📋 research-synthesis

> **Synthesize user research into themes, insights, and recommendations**
>
> Usage: `research-synthesis <research data, transcripts, or survey results>`

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Synthesize user research data into actionable insights. See the **user-research** skill for research methods, interview guides, and analysis frameworks.

## Usage

```
research-synthesis $ARGUMENTS
```

## What I Accept

- Interview transcripts or notes
- Survey results (CSV, pasted data)
- Usability test recordings or notes
- Support tickets or feedback
- NPS/CSAT responses
- App store reviews

## Output

```markdown
## Research Synthesis: [Study Name]
**Method:** [Interviews / Survey / Usability Test] | **Participants:** [X]
**Date:** [Date range] | **Researcher:** [Name]

### Executive Summary
[3-4 sentence overview of key findings]

### Key Themes

#### Theme 1: [Name]
**Prevalence:** [X of Y participants]
**Summary:** [What this theme is about]
**Supporting Evidence:**
- "[Quote]" — P[X]
- "[Quote]" — P[X]
**Implication:** [What this means for the product]

#### Theme 2: [Name]
[Same format]

### Insights → Opportunities

| Insight | Opportunity | Impact | Effort |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------|
| [What we learned] | [What we could do] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |

### User Segments Identified
| Segment | Characteristics | Needs | Size |
|---------|----------------|-------|------|
| [Name] | [Description] | [Key needs] | [Rough %] |

### Recommendations
1. **[High priority]** — [Why, based on which findings]
2. **[Medium priority]** — [Why]
3. **[Lower priority]** — [Why]

### Questions for Further Research
- [What we still don't know]

### Methodology Notes
[How the research was conducted, any limitations or biases to note]
```

## If Connectors Available

If **~~user feedback** is connected:
- Pull support tickets, feature requests, and NPS responses to supplement research data
- Cross-reference themes with real user complaints and requests

If **~~product analytics** is connected:
- Validate qualitative findings with usage data and behavioral metrics
- Quantify the impact of identified pain points

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Search for prior research studies and findings to compare against
- Publish the synthesis to your research repository

## Tips

1. **Include raw quotes** — Direct participant quotes make insights credible and memorable.
2. **Separate observations from interpretations** — "5 of 8 users clicked the wrong button" is an observation. "The button placement is confusing" is an interpretation.
3. **Quantify where possible** — "Most users" is vague. "7 of 10 users" is specific.

## 📋 ux-copy

> **Write or review UX copy — microcopy, error messages, empty states, CTAs**
>
> Usage: `ux-copy <context or copy to review>`

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Write or review UX copy for any interface context. See the **ux-writing** skill for copy principles, patterns, and voice/tone guidance.

## Usage

```
ux-copy $ARGUMENTS
```

## What I Need From You

- **Context**: What screen, flow, or feature?
- **User state**: What is the user trying to do? How are they feeling?
- **Tone**: Formal, friendly, playful, reassuring?
- **Constraints**: Character limits, platform guidelines?

## Output

```markdown
## UX Copy: [Context]

### Recommended Copy
**[Element]**: [Copy]

### Alternatives
| Option | Copy | Tone | Best For |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| A | [Copy] | [Tone] | [When to use] |
| B | [Copy] | [Tone] | [When to use] |
| C | [Copy] | [Tone] | [When to use] |

### Rationale
[Why this copy works — user context, clarity, action-orientation]

### Localization Notes
[Anything translators should know — idioms to avoid, character expansion, cultural context]
```

## Common UX Copy Types

- **CTAs**: Clear, specific, action-oriented ("Start free trial" not "Submit")
- **Error messages**: What happened, why, and how to fix it
- **Empty states**: Guide the user to take their first action
- **Confirmation dialogs**: Make the consequences clear
- **Onboarding**: Progressive disclosure, one concept at a time
- **Tooltips**: Concise, helpful, never obvious
- **Loading states**: Set expectations, reduce anxiety

## If Connectors Available

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Pull your brand voice guidelines and content style guide
- Check for existing copy patterns and terminology standards

If **~~design tool** is connected:
- View the screen context in Figma to understand the full user flow
- Check character limits and layout constraints from the design

## Tips

1. **Be specific about context** — "Error message when payment fails" is better than "error message."
2. **Share your brand voice** — "We're professional but warm" helps me match your tone.
3. **Consider the user's emotional state** — Error messages need empathy. Success messages can celebrate.

# Skills

## 🧠 accessibility-review

> Audit designs and code for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Trigger with "is this accessible", "accessibility check", "WCAG audit", "can screen readers use this", "color contrast", or when the user asks about making designs or code accessible to all users.

Evaluate designs and implementations against WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## WCAG 2.1 AA Quick Reference

### Perceivable
- **1.1.1** Non-text content has alt text
- **1.3.1** Info and structure conveyed semantically
- **1.4.3** Contrast ratio >= 4.5:1 (normal text), >= 3:1 (large text)
- **1.4.11** Non-text contrast >= 3:1 (UI components, graphics)

### Operable
- **2.1.1** All functionality available via keyboard
- **2.4.3** Logical focus order
- **2.4.7** Visible focus indicator
- **2.5.5** Touch target >= 44x44 CSS pixels

### Understandable
- **3.2.1** Predictable on focus (no unexpected changes)
- **3.3.1** Error identification (describe the error)
- **3.3.2** Labels or instructions for inputs

### Robust
- **4.1.2** Name, role, value for all UI components

## Common Issues

1. Insufficient color contrast
2. Missing form labels
3. No keyboard access to interactive elements
4. Missing alt text on meaningful images
5. Focus traps in modals
6. Missing ARIA landmarks
7. Auto-playing media without controls
8. Time limits without extension options

## Testing Approach

1. Automated scan (catches ~30% of issues)
2. Keyboard-only navigation
3. Screen reader testing (VoiceOver, NVDA)
4. Color contrast verification
5. Zoom to 200% — does layout break?

---

## 🧠 design-critique

> Evaluate designs for usability, visual hierarchy, consistency, and adherence to design principles. Trigger with "what do you think of this design", "give me feedback on", "critique this", "review this mockup", or when the user shares a design and asks for opinions.

Provide structured, actionable design feedback.

## Critique Framework

### 1. First Impression (2 seconds)
- What draws the eye first? Is that correct?
- What's the emotional reaction?
- Is the purpose immediately clear?

### 2. Usability
- Can the user accomplish their goal?
- Is the navigation intuitive?
- Are interactive elements obvious?
- Are there unnecessary steps?

### 3. Visual Hierarchy
- Is there a clear reading order?
- Are the right elements emphasized?
- Is whitespace used effectively?
- Is typography creating the right hierarchy?

### 4. Consistency
- Does it follow the design system?
- Are spacing, colors, and typography consistent?
- Do similar elements behave similarly?

### 5. Accessibility
- Color contrast ratios
- Touch target sizes
- Text readability
- Alternative text for images

## How to Give Feedback

- **Be specific**: "The CTA competes with the navigation" not "the layout is confusing"
- **Explain why**: Connect feedback to design principles or user needs
- **Suggest alternatives**: Don't just identify problems, propose solutions
- **Acknowledge what works**: Good feedback includes positive observations
- **Match the stage**: Early exploration gets different feedback than final polish

---

## 🧠 design-handoff

> Create comprehensive developer handoff documentation from designs. Trigger with "handoff to engineering", "developer specs", "implementation notes", "design specs for developers", or when a design needs to be translated into detailed implementation guidance.

Create clear, complete handoff documentation so developers can implement designs accurately.

## What to Include

### Visual Specifications
- Exact measurements (padding, margins, widths)
- Design token references (colors, typography, spacing)
- Responsive breakpoints and behavior
- Component variants and states

### Interaction Specifications
- Click/tap behavior
- Hover states
- Transitions and animations (duration, easing)
- Gesture support (swipe, pinch, long-press)

### Content Specifications
- Character limits
- Truncation behavior
- Empty states
- Loading states
- Error states

### Edge Cases
- Minimum/maximum content
- International text (longer strings)
- Slow connections
- Missing data

### Accessibility
- Focus order
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard interactions
- Screen reader announcements

## Principles

1. **Don't assume** — If it's not specified, the developer will guess. Specify everything.
2. **Use tokens, not values** — Reference `spacing-md` not `16px`.
3. **Show all states** — Default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty.
4. **Describe the why** — "This collapses on mobile because users primarily use one-handed" helps developers make good judgment calls.

---

## 🧠 design-system-management

> Manage design tokens, component libraries, and pattern documentation. Trigger with "design system", "component library", "design tokens", "style guide", or when the user asks about maintaining consistency across designs.

Help build, maintain, and evolve design systems.

## Components of a Design System

### Design Tokens
Atomic values that define the visual language:
- Colors (brand, semantic, neutral)
- Typography (scale, weights, line heights)
- Spacing (scale, component padding)
- Borders (radius, width)
- Shadows (elevation levels)
- Motion (durations, easings)

### Components
Reusable UI elements with defined:
- Variants (primary, secondary, ghost)
- States (default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error)
- Sizes (sm, md, lg)
- Behavior (interactions, animations)
- Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard)

### Patterns
Common UI solutions combining components:
- Forms (input groups, validation, submission)
- Navigation (sidebar, tabs, breadcrumbs)
- Data display (tables, cards, lists)
- Feedback (toasts, modals, inline messages)

## Principles

1. **Consistency over creativity** — The system exists so teams don't reinvent the wheel
2. **Flexibility within constraints** — Components should be composable, not rigid
3. **Document everything** — If it's not documented, it doesn't exist
4. **Version and migrate** — Breaking changes need migration paths

---

## 🧠 user-research

> Plan, conduct, and synthesize user research. Trigger with "user research plan", "interview guide", "usability test", "survey design", "research questions", or when the user needs help with any aspect of understanding their users through research.

Help plan, execute, and synthesize user research studies.

## Research Methods

| Method | Best For | Sample Size | Time |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| User interviews | Deep understanding of needs and motivations | 5-8 | 2-4 weeks |
| Usability testing | Evaluating a specific design or flow | 5-8 | 1-2 weeks |
| Surveys | Quantifying attitudes and preferences | 100+ | 1-2 weeks |
| Card sorting | Information architecture decisions | 15-30 | 1 week |
| Diary studies | Understanding behavior over time | 10-15 | 2-8 weeks |
| A/B testing | Comparing specific design choices | Statistical significance | 1-4 weeks |

## Interview Guide Structure

1. **Warm-up** (5 min): Build rapport, explain the session
2. **Context** (10 min): Understand their current workflow
3. **Deep dive** (20 min): Explore the specific topic
4. **Reaction** (10 min): Show concepts or prototypes
5. **Wrap-up** (5 min): Anything we missed? Thank them.

## Analysis Framework

- **Affinity mapping**: Group observations into themes
- **Impact/effort matrix**: Prioritize findings
- **Journey mapping**: Visualize the user experience over time
- **Jobs to be done**: Understand what users are hiring your product to do

## Deliverables

- Research plan (objectives, methods, timeline, participants)
- Interview guide (questions, probes, activities)
- Synthesis report (themes, insights, recommendations)
- Highlight reel (key quotes and observations)

---

## 🧠 ux-writing

> Write effective microcopy for user interfaces. Trigger with "write copy for", "help with UX copy", "what should this button say", "error message for", "empty state copy", or when the user needs help with any interface text.

Write clear, concise, and helpful interface copy.

## Principles

1. **Clear**: Say exactly what you mean. No jargon, no ambiguity.
2. **Concise**: Use the fewest words that convey the full meaning.
3. **Consistent**: Same terms for the same things everywhere.
4. **Useful**: Every word should help the user accomplish their goal.
5. **Human**: Write like a helpful person, not a robot.

## Copy Patterns

### CTAs
- Start with a verb: "Start free trial", "Save changes", "Download report"
- Be specific: "Create account" not "Submit"
- Match the outcome to the label

### Error Messages
Structure: What happened + Why + How to fix
- "Payment declined. Your card was declined by your bank. Try a different card or contact your bank."

### Empty States
Structure: What this is + Why it's empty + How to start
- "No projects yet. Create your first project to start collaborating with your team."

### Confirmation Dialogs
- Make the action clear: "Delete 3 files?" not "Are you sure?"
- Describe consequences: "This can't be undone"
- Label buttons with the action: "Delete files" / "Keep files" not "OK" / "Cancel"

## Voice and Tone

Adapt tone to context:
- **Success**: Celebratory but not over the top
